ðŸ“Œ n8n Automation Projects 

This repository contains two automation workflows created using n8n as part of a workshop during my Data Science Full Stack course, under the guidance of @kodigitaccount in my datascience full stack journey.This is a workshop conducted by @kodidigitaccount.

ðŸ”¹ *1. Simple Chatbot using n8n*
A basic chatbot flow built in n8n that receives user input, processes it with conditional logic, and returns appropriate responses. This showcases how no-code tools like n8n can be used to simulate chatbot behavior without writing traditional code.

ðŸ”¹ *2. Google Sheet Plan Maker*
An automation that interacts with Google Sheets to dynamically create, update, or retrieve rows based on input data. It can be used for daily planning, task management, or tracking logs automatically via form inputs or integrations.

ðŸ›  *Tools Used*
n8n â€“ Open-source workflow automation tool

Google Sheets â€“ For data storage and planning

Webhooks & Triggers â€“ To automate flow between components
